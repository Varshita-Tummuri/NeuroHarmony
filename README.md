# NeuroHarmony

Our Solution is a voice-enabled, AI-powered productivity and emotional support app designed for individuals who struggle with executive dysfunction, cognitive overload, or mental health challenges. The app offers a personalized, distraction-free experience that bridges emotional awareness with task management—built with neurodivergent users in mind, but accessible for anyone seeking structure and calm.
With our app, users can:
🎙 Schedule tasks and set reminders using voice commands
📆 Build personalized routines that adapt to energy levels and mood
🌡 Get real-time emotional check-ins and support suggestions
🔔 Receive smart, non-intrusive reminders and nudges
💖 Access wellness tools like journaling, breathing exercises, and focus mode
🩺 Use the integrated period tracker for cycle-aware recommendations
🎨 Customize the app with themes, mascots, and sensory-friendly settings
Built with empathy, powered by AI—this is more than a productivity app. It’s a daily companion for minds that work differently.


🎯 Our Mission
To create a safe, adaptive, and supportive space where productivity and emotional health co-exist, especially for minds that operate outside the neurotypical box.
Our app listens. It adapts. It nudges with kindness. It lets users function on their terms.
