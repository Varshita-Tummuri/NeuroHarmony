# NeuroHarmony

Our Solution is a voice-enabled, AI-powered productivity and emotional support app designed for individuals who struggle with executive dysfunction, cognitive overload, or mental health challenges. The app offers a personalized, distraction-free experience that bridges emotional awareness with task management—built with neurodivergent users in mind, but accessible for anyone seeking structure and calm.
With our app, users can:
1. 🎙 Schedule tasks and set reminders using voice commands
2. 📆 Build personalized routines that adapt to energy levels and mood
3. 🌡 Get real-time emotional check-ins and support suggestions
4. 🔔 Receive smart, non-intrusive reminders and nudges
5. 💖 Access wellness tools like journaling, breathing exercises, and focus mode
6. 🩺 Use the integrated period tracker for cycle-aware recommendations
7. 🎨 Customize the app with themes, mascots, and sensory-friendly settings
Built with empathy, powered by AI—this is more than a productivity app. It’s a daily companion for minds that work differently.

❗ Problem Statement
Despite the abundance of productivity tools, most digital task managers are not emotionally responsive. They are built on logic-driven interfaces that assume users are always functioning at optimal cognitive levels—this alienates individuals with:
1. Executive dysfunction
2. Burnout
3. Neurodivergent traits (ADHD, ASD, etc.)
4. Depression or anxiety
5. Cognitive fatigue from chronic stress or overworking
6. These individuals often face decision paralysis, emotional dysregulation, and sensory overload—making it harder to start, structure, or stick to tasks.
7. There is no single platform that blends:
8. Task scheduling
9. Emotional check-ins
10. Voice-based inputs
11. Wellness support in a holistic and accessible manner.


🎯 Our Mission
To create a safe, adaptive, and supportive space where productivity and emotional health co-exist, especially for minds that operate outside the neurotypical box.
Our app listens. It adapts. It nudges with kindness. It lets users function on their terms.
